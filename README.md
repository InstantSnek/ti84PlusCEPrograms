BINCOEFF  Finds the coefficient of one item in a binomial expansion

BINOMTHM  Does the binomial theorem to find coefficients of all tems ina a binomial expansion. May also be used to get a specific row of Pascal's Triangle.

CMPLEXRT  Finds the N roots of a complex number Z = A + Bi

CPMLXPWR  Finds the Nth power of a complex number Z = A + Bi, outputs both complex rectangular and polar coordinates.

CMPLXTRG  Converts from rectangular/imaginary coordinates to polar coordinates, or a component vector to a polar vector.

CONICROT  Graphs a rotated parabola as given by Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = G

FINDXWY   Dependency for MVINTGRL. Calculates the x value where the function Y1 equals D in the interval from A to B

GETR      dependency for the problems, solves for magnitude/hypotenuse

GETTHETA  Dependency, finds the angle on a unit circle from coordinates.

MVINTGRL  Determines the average value of a function over an interval and where the function equals that average value.

POLTOCMP  Converts polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates, or converts vector from polar to component form, works in both radians and degrees.

QUADRATIC Solves a quadratic equation, works with imaginary zeros.

RATNLPOS  Finds all possible rational zeros.
